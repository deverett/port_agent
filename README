OOI C++ code

Prereqs
=======

For testing the google test framework and socat needs to be installed. 

On OS X:
brew install gtest
brew install gmock
brew install socat


Project setup
=============
This project is setup using automake and autoconf.  Every source directory 
needs a Makefile.am file.  Also each make file must exsist in the 
AC_CONFIG_FILES variable in the configure.ac file in the project source dir.

We are using the google test framework for unit testing.  Every source directory
should have a test directory.

Binary Releases
===============
Release are number in dotted format following the major/minor/bug versioning
scheme.  When making a modification to any source files you need to tag the
repository after all files are committed and checked in.  Make sure that if
you do make code modifications that you do a point release.

Procedure:
- run all tests
   * make check
- Release in a virtualenv with fabric installed. (makevirtualenv fab,
  easy_install fabric)
- workon fab (work in your fab virtualenv)
- fab release (following the prompts)

Deployment Instructions:

- fab ion_alpha deploy
- fab ion_beta deploy

Updating Makefile.am or configure.ac
====================================
Whenever Makefile.am or configure.ac are update files must be rebuild.  To do
this run:

$ autoreconf --force --install

When adding a new target library make sure to add the target to 
src/Makfile.am.inc.

Building the project
====================
$ ./configure --prefix=<install_dir>
$ make

# Run all tests
$ make check

# Install code
$ make install

# cleaning up
$ make clean
