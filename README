OOI C++ code

Prereqs
=======

For testing the google test framework and socat needs to be installed. 

On OS X:
brew install gtest
brew install gmock
brew install socat


Project setup
=============
This project is setup using automake and autoconf.  Every source directory 
needs a Makefile.am file.  Also each make file must exsist in the 
AC_CONFIG_FILES variable in the configure.ac file in the project source dir.

We are using the google test framework for unit testing.  Every source directory
should have a test directory.

Updating Makefile.am or configure.ac
====================================
Whenever Makefile.am or configure.ac are update files must be rebuild.  To do
this run:

$ autoreconf --force --install

When adding a new target library make sure to add the target to 
src/Makfile.am.inc.

Building the project
====================
$ ./configure --prefix=<install_dir>
$ make

# Run all tests
$ make check

# Install code
$ make install

# cleaning up
$ make clean
